# Com-Sci-Maze


It is a Maze game that you control the character and use 'awsd' to change direction. You need to find the exit of the maze in 1 minutes, otherwise you will lose the game. 

To start the game , you need to click your mouse to enter the game, and click again to restart game.

For my original idea, I was going to use ml5 posenet and upload four of my trained poses. Each pose would represent one direction, YMCK. For example, you do the Y pose with your body, when the model detectes you are doing the pose, it will send input to the game, and the character will turn left. 

Sadly, I couldn't convert my trained model and my Javascript into python, and I am in a large workload for my final. So I didn't got enough time to finish the project. This will be my next step when I have some time to work with the project!
